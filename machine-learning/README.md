# Deploy and monitor machine learning models on IBM Cloud

We will look at the different AI/ML services offered on IBM Cloud. 
1. We start by looking at the cognitive services and APIs including Natural Language Processing, Chatbots and Visual Recognition. 
2. We then look at the brand new `AutoAI` service in conjunction with the complete data science life cycle. 
3. Finally, we look at how to use some of the popular open source machine learning libraries inside Watson Studio. 

The steps for this workshop are details in the [ibm-cloud-education-summit-ml.pdf document here](./ibm-cloud-education-summit-ml). 

## Overview
1. Sign up / Log into [IBM Cloud](http://bit.ly/ibm-cloud-summit-2019) - http://bit.ly/ibm-cloud-summit-2019
2. Create Watson Studio Service.
3. Sign into Watson Studio and create a new Data Science Project. It also creates a Cloud Object Store for you.
4. Upload csv data to your project.
5. Add a new AutoAI Experiment to your project.
6. Create a ML Model and save it to IBM Cloud.
7. Create a new deployment on IBM Cloud.
8. Test your model !
